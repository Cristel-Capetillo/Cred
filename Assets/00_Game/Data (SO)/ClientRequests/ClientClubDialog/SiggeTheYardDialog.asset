  - "Oh hi I didn\u2019t see you there, I was busy tweeting my support for Black
    Lives Matter. Damn, we\u2019re doing a good job with that. I\u2019m going to
    The Yard tonight to drink IPA\u2019s while explaining feminism to much, much
    younger women I\u2019m trying to bring back home. I\u2019m looking for cheap
    basic pants for around 400 dollars."
  - "Hey! I\u2019ve met this lovely young woman called Sianca, she works with human
    resources. I love a woman with ambition. I\u2019m going to meet her and her friends
    at The Yard tonight, I need to look cool. They can't know I'm that much older
    than her."
  - "Sup! I\u2019m going on a date tonight with my colleague's daughter, she just
    turned 18. She probably has no idea how inflation works, I'll take my time to
    explain it to her. I need something that makes me look young, biker pants\u2026?"
  - "What a demonstration! More people should really get involved in women's rights,
    I had to explain some things to the woman who chanted nursery rhymes. I think
    she appreciated it. Do what you can for other people! My motto is: Learn something
    new everyday. Now we\u2019re off to celebrate on The Yard, make me look how I
    feel- successful."
  - "Well hello there. Need something fresh, clean and hot for this girl I'm seeing.
    She\u2019s apparently studying to become a nurse. Hot. Help me find something
    she\u2019ll like! I can ask her to post us on her \u201CCred\u201D account, i\u2019ll
    make sure you're tagged."
  - "It\u2019s time for me to go to The Yard and see my old friend Sven, he\u2019s
    always having the time of his life there. Exciting\u2026 I\u2019ll probably just
    get bored so let\u2019s see if I can find a beautiful soul to spend the night
    with. Make me look good, and she will probably post us on \u201CCred\u201D."
  - "Hello you. I have THE WORST hangover ever, but a girl asked me out to go to
    The Yard with her friends. I just can\u2019t say no to that. Make me look really
    good, I don\u2019t want them to find someone better looking."
  - "Oh I was on FIRE last weekend! I celebrated my birthday with this hot girl,
    Sianca, and she told me I look like Justin Bieber in 2010. I think that was a
    good thing\u2026. right? Anyway she has been ghosting me for some days so I need
    to look my best tonight if I run into her."
