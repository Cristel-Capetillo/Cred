  - "I\u2019ve got a DJ-gig at this old-people place called Niche tonight and need
    something to blend in. I\u2019m hoping to go home with a cougar tonight. Any
    suggestions on what I should wear? Preferably something black."
  - "Sup! I just visited my childhood friend and apparently he\u2019s become a real
    douchebag. Anyway I\u2019m going out with Siggy tonight at Niche and I don't
    want to blend in. Give me something that screams \u201CI\u2019m not boring\u201D."
  - "Heya! I saw that you\u2019ve gotten some more followers since we last saw each
    other, that\u2019s really cool i\u2019m super excited for you. Let\u2019s say
    if you do a good job styling me for my DJ gig on Niche, I\u2019ll post you on
    \u201CCred\u201D and see if more people follow you."
  - "Suuup. I have the worst hangover EVER, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from having
    fun. I\u2019m meeting up with my friend to go to Niche, apparently she\u2019s
    seeing Siggy- my childhood friend. Weird."
  - "YOO! I\u2019ve missed you, I got so many compliments on my outfit on my latest
    gig. I need to impress some more people. Apparently Niche is hosting one of the
    most famous DJs of all time, I NEED to look good. I trust you!"
  - "Wazzup. I\u2019ve had a hard time finding a really cool pair of pants, I want
    to stand out tonight when I\u2019m partying at Niche? A would totally rock a
    skit as well. Could you find me something?"
  - "Hi there! I looked bomb last night, I\u2019m so happy you styled me for my DJ
    session, everyone asked me about my jacket and I told them I got it from you!
    Hopefully you will get some new followers after that. Tonight I want to go outside
    my comfort zone, could you find me something nice?"
  - "Sup! Me and my friends are going out celebrating my birthday tonight at Niche!
    Because I\u2019m a bad bleep, I need to look the best I ever have, periodt."
