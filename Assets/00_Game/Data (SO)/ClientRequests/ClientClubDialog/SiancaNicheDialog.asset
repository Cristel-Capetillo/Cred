  - I just posted a picture of this outfit and forgot I was supposed to wear it to
    Niche tonight. Now I desperately need something new to show my followers. Please
    help me!
  - "Hi! I just met this older guy who thinks I'm working in human resources. I\u2019m
    not. Obviously. Help me look the part, I don\u2019t want him to find out I lied
    about being an influencer\u2026"
  - "Someone just told me I could never get high enough style points when I\u2019m
    going out to Niche? I\u2019m furious. Prove them wrong."
  - "Hi sis! I\u2019m loving your new business, it\u2019s already looking fly! I\u2019m
    going to the old people place Niche tonight to look for someone who can pay for
    me and my friends drinks all night. Make me look approachable and not too hot.
    That will make them feel intimidated."
  - "Hi! I\u2019m so excited, a new sponsor wanted me to collaborate with them! They
    saw my latest post on \u201CCred\u201D and now they want me to promote their
    new alcohol free drink. I\u2019m going to Niche tonight though, no way I'm showing
    up somewhere else with something alcohol free"
  - "O-M-G! I just saw your \u201CCred\u201D page, you\u2019re getting so many followers!
    I\u2019m so proud. Tonight i\u2019m going to Niche to have a drink with a guy
    named Siggy. Exciting!"
