  - "Hey, I didn\u2019t sleep tonight - I need something to cover the bags under
    my eyes before heading to The Yard, even though the music is totally basic. Preferably
    something black. Any suggestions?"
  - "The influencer Scianca is all over me every time I\u2019m at The Yard, how is
    it not obvious I'm not straight\u2026 She\u2019s really sweet though and if she
    posts me, I could get some new fans\u2026 Make me look like an influencer!"
  - "Tonight is the night! I\u2019m performing at The Yard and I have a new act I
    haven\u2019t done before, it\u2019s going to be a lot of photographers so I need
    to look my best. Give me something that makes me feel like I\u2019m on FIRE!"
  - "The weekly magazine just wrote an article about me! They say i\u2019m the best
    dressed DJ of all time! THANK YOU! This has to be celebrated with an even better
    look!"
  - "Yo Yo Yo! Guess who is going to play at The Yard tonight. I just got back from
    France, a good old M\xE9nage \xE0 trois made my weekend even better. I really
    feel like a new person, can you give me something that makes everyone turn their
    heads."
