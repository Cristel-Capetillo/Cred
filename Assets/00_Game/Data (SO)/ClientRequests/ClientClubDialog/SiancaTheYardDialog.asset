  dialog:
  - Hi, I just used my new biker shorts and now I need something brand-new to wear
    to The Yard tonight. Preferably something eco-friendly
  - "Ahhh! My rival just stole my outfit for tonight! I\u2019m furious! I need something
    good and I need it FAST!"
  - "Hi sis! I need to upgrade my outfit for tonight, something with high style points.
    I need to impress a photographer who's at The Yard tonight. If I look good I\u2019ll
    tag you in my story on my \u201CCred\u201D page."
  - I am so ready for friday. My favourite DJ, Sven, is performing tonight. Do you
    think Sven is straight? Maybe I should make a move....I could get free drinks
    then. Anyway, I need to look gorgeous tonight. Maybe something green?
  - "Hi sis! I\u2019ve missed your sense of style, my friend wanted to style me but
    I ended up looking like an idiot. I think she tried to set me up. I need to outshine
    her tonight. Make me look so beautiful that Chris Pratt would kiss me."
  - "Hello beautiful! So many people asked me where I got my outfit from last night!
    I\u2019m so happy to see your business grow. Tonight I\u2019m going to The Yard
    to do a promotion and they want me to post it on \u201CCred\u201D. I\u2019m thinking
    of something that makes me look expensive!"
  - "I\u2019m SO excited! All my girlfriends will celebrate my 100k followers today
    at The Yard. I need something that makes me look like a million bucks! I\u2019m
    so proud of myself."
  - "Hi sis! Me and Sven are going out to The Yard tonight, he\u2019s meeting a date
    there and I\u2019m there for moral support. Good thing I know the bartender so
    I can drink for free tonight. I don\u2019t want to steal the spotlight from Sven,
    give me something glamorous but subtle."
  - "What if I told you\u2026 that I just got a BIG fashion brand to have me in their
    commercial! I can\u2019t stop smiling! I need to look REALLY good for this, could
    you style me?"
