  - "I just followed a right-wing politician on Instagram and so my sponsor dropped
    me. I\u2019m going to The Hole tonight and need something leathery. Something
    that makes me look like I could kiss a girl - but not enough that someone actually
    does. I\u2019m not gay\u2026 Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that!
    So you got something like that?"
  - "Hi! I\u2019m so excited, Sven invited me to be his backup when he has a DJ session
    tonight at The Hole. I need to look cool! Can you hook me up?"
  - "Hi best stylist ever! I\u2019m going to The Hole tonight and they have a theme
    night of \u201CSwag 2021\u201D. I need to look super cool! I trust you!"
  - "Hello! I\u2019m going out with my conservative cousins tonight, I don\u2019t
    like them so I\u2019m taking them to The Hole. That will probably make them a
    bit uncomfortable, serves them right for being closed minded. I\u2019ll post
    it on \u201CCred\u201D later!"
  - Hi sis! I got a comment on my latest post yesterday that said I don't care about
    the environment. Not true! I know you work a lot with upcycling, maybe you have
    something for me so I can prove them wrong.
  - "Hi sis! I need something that has high style points tonight, a famous DJ is
    going to play at The Hole tonight. I\u2019ve heard he only likes women in designer
    clothes. Whatever you do, make me look RICH!"
  - "Hi queen! I\u2019ve missed your styling. Tonight I\u2019m going out by myself.
    I just rewatched Sex in the City and I realised that Samantha usually goes out
    partying by herself. She is my new idol so I want to look exactly like her."
  - "Hi sis! The Hole is going to be LIT tonight! I\u2019ve just gotten an assistant
    so we\u2019re going out to celebrate. I want something that says \u201CI\u2019m
    reaching for the sky\u201D. Could you do that?"
