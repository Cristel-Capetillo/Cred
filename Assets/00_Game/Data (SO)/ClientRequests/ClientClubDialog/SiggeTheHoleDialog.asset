  - "So I\u2019m meeting this 20 y/o goth chick at The Hole tonight. It\u2019s a
    gay club. I love her inclusivity! I want to look gay, but not TOO gay. I don\u2019t
    want to have another experience like tha\u2026 I-I- mean I don\u2019t want AN
    experience like that\u2026 So I\u2019m thinking like a pink baseball cap and\u2026
    A choker? For a total of 850 dollars?"
