  - "So I\u2019m meeting this 20 y/o goth chick at The Hole tonight. It\u2019s a
    gay club. I love her inclusivity! I want to look gay, but not TOO gay. I don\u2019t
    want to have another experience like tha\u2026 I-I- mean I don\u2019t want AN
    experience like that\u2026 So I\u2019m thinking like a pink baseball cap and\u2026
    A choker? For a total of 850 dollars?"
  - "Heartbroken. Again. I can never seem to find the right woman. Maybe it\u2019s
    time I try something new\u2026 I\u2019m going to the Hole tonight, my friend
    is a regular there I need to fit in. Make it work genius."
  - "Hey! I\u2019m happy to see your business growing! Thanks to me I\u2019d say,
    I talk about you all the time. Only good things of course. I\u2019m going to
    The Hole tonight, I'm thinking all black, like Batman."
  - Oh well, friday once again. Time to spice things up. I want to go to The Hole
    tonight, they always deliver a good time.
  - "Hello there! It\u2019s time to get my FREAK on tonight at The Hole! Oh no..
    I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026 I\u2019m seeing a girl named Sianca\u2026.
    Just make me look good."
  - "Hello. I\u2019m very upset at every club. Apparently only ONE argument can get
    you banned for a month, I\u2019ll go undercover at The Hole tonight they won\u2019t
    recognize me. Give me something to blend in with"
  - "Oh well. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy with my new colleague, but since I\u2019m
    SUCH a nice guy I have to buy him a drink. Make me look better than him."
  - "Well Well Well, I see your business is growing. Thanks to me. You\u2019re welcome.
    To celebrate your success, create a look that will leave everyone shook. I\u2019m
    thinking choker?"
