  - "Yo, I took an uber black here straight from a victorian cosplay orgie. I\u2019m
    heading to a pre-party now before The Hole and need something fresh to wear.
    Preferably something black."
  - "Hey. Going back to my favourite place on earth, The Hole. Tonight i\u2019m not
    working so I want to feel relaxed. I\u2019m feeling like red (wine) tonight."
  - "I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally summer. I\u2019m so happy I could cry.
    I\u2019m celebrating the 20 degrees with all my friends at The Hole tonight.
    They might let my DJ for a while as well so make me stand out from the crowd.
    You know i\u2019ll post about you!"
  - "SUP! I\u2019m happy to see that it\u2019s going well for you. I might be able
    to get you some new followers. I have a promotion gig for a champagne company
    and they\u2019re going to interview me and take some photos, I\u2019ll mention
    you\u2019re my stylist. Make us both proud!"
  - "Yo. I\u2019m taking Siggy out for a round of drinks on The Hole, he recently
    commented on my ants being \u201Ca lot\u201D. So please make it even more this
    time! You know I\u2019m petty!"
